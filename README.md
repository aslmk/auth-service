# Auth-Service

Auth-Service is an **educational project** built to explore and understand how modern authentication and authorization systems work in practice.  
It demonstrates the implementation of core security features such as **session-based authentication**, **OAuth2 integration (Google)**, **two-factor authentication**, **email verification**, **password recovery**, and **ReCaptcha** ‚Äî all implemented manually (without third-party auth libraries) using Spring Boot.
